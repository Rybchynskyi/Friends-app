## For deploying:

This project is the practical task from cottans-school

We receive the JSON object from the randomuser.me web-site, which sends information about random users.
The main task was in creating an interesting interface that can visualize this information.

I decided to create an interface with cards for each user. It's a good way for systematization a lot of similar information.

As you can see, I chose glassmorphysm style. It's very simple in coding and quite interesting style:

</p>

Grid layout in CSS - it's a good way for coding these cards. That's why I used it.

Also, I made filters for better surfing in the list.

</p>

For direct searching - I made a search function. After typing the letters of the name or numbers of the phone - the quantity of cards with the result becomes smaller and smaller up to the one card:

Search input for the mobile phones have unhide animation that helps to be focused on really needed things:

Sorting, filtering and searching made using JS and the page works without refreshing.

This way, I have achieved good results in user experience.
